# Charadex

The free and easy way to log your species designs and show it off!

### Disclaimer

I'm not especially good at JS, so I apologize in advance if anyone who knows their stuff sees it and barfs. Obviously I encourage any optimizing of this product. I'm also extremely new to github and all of this so I'm very sorry for any glaring mistakes I may make slhfsdklf

### Pros

- Easy masterlist submissions - literally just add a row and the info, then just keep going about your business!
- (Can be) completely free to run, as long as you're hosting somewhere like gitpages or neocities.
- Can be used to keep up with the characters you sell as well!
- Comes with a small CSS sheet that you can use to edit the page a bit more. You _will_ need some CSS knowledge for more advanced styling, but there are variables that allow you to switch out the colors rather easily.

### Cons

- Absolutely not meant for species with designs in the thousands. It'll end up being too much of a straight for google sheets. If you have that many design, I recommend lorekeeper or commissioning someone with fullstack knowledge to help you out.
- Hard to edit the sheet to include more information. If you absolutely don't know anything about sheets or JS, you're going to have a really bad time.
- No search function or _real_ pagination function on the outward page. (I'm not smart enough to add these in yet...but one day.)

# Hosting

I will only be showing you how to host 2 places - on gitpages and on neocities, since these two places are completely free to host on (within reason).
